    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization is a fundamental concept in finance, based on Modern Portfolio Theory developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952. The key idea is to maximize the portfolio's expected return for a given level of risk, or minimize risk for a given level of expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "1. **Expected Return**: The anticipated return of an investment over a period of time.\n",
    "2. **Volatility**: A measure of the risk, calculated as the standard deviation of returns.\n",
    "3. **Covariance**: A measure of how two assets move together.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Frontier**: The set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markowitz model uses these inputs:\n",
    "- Expected returns for each asset\n",
    "- Covariance matrix of returns\n",
    "- Portfolio weights (percentage invested in each asset)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model calculates:\n",
    "- Portfolio expected return: $E(R_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)$\n",

    "### The Sharpe Ratio: Measuring Risk-Adjusted Return\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe ratio, developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is a widely used measure in finance to evaluate the performance of an investment or a portfolio. It provides a way to compare different investments by considering both their returns and their risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe ratio is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $S$ is the Sharpe ratio\n",
    "- $R_p$ is the return of the portfolio\n",
    "- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate of return\n",
    "- $\\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return (i.e., the portfolio's volatility)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.\n",
    "- The ratio quantifies the additional return an investor can expect to receive for taking on extra risk.\n",
    "- It allows for comparison between portfolios with different levels of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk-Adjusted Return**: The Sharpe ratio adjusts return by the level of risk taken to achieve that return.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benchmark Comparison**: It uses the risk-free rate as a benchmark, showing excess return per unit of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Volatility as Risk Measure**: The ratio uses standard deviation as a proxy for risk, which assumes returns are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Period Sensitivity**: The Sharpe ratio can vary significantly depending on the time period used for calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limitations**: It doesn't distinguish between upside and downside volatility and may not be suitable for non-normally distributed returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portfolio Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of different portfolios or investment strategies.\n",
    "- **Manager Assessment**: Evaluating the skill of investment managers.\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Helping in the construction of portfolios with optimal risk-return tradeoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If a portfolio has an average annual return of 15%, the risk-free rate is 3%, and the portfolio's annual standard deviation is 10%, the Sharpe ratio would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\frac{15\\% - 3\\%}{10\\%} = 1.2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that for each unit of risk (volatility) taken, the portfolio is generating 1.2 units of excess return over the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Sharpe ratio is crucial for investors and financial analysts as it provides a standardized measure of risk-adjusted performance, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different investment opportunities.\n"

    "### Monte Carlo Simulation: Embracing Uncertainty in Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in processes that involve significant uncertainty. It's named after the famous casino in Monaco, reflecting the method's reliance on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Concept of \"Intervening Random Variables\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world scenarios, we encounter processes that are influenced by factors which are inherently uncertain or unpredictable. These factors are represented as random variables in our models, and they \"intervene\" in the process, making exact predictions challenging. Monte Carlo simulation helps us handle this uncertainty by running many scenarios with different random outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Example: Weather Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the task of predicting tomorrow's temperature. While we know today's temperature, several uncertain factors influence tomorrow's weather:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normal daily temperature fluctuations\n",
    "2. Wind effects\n",
    "3. Cloud cover\n",
    "4. Unexpected events (e.g., sudden weather system changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these factors can be modeled as a random variable with a specific probability distribution based on historical data or expert knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Monte Carlo Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Definition**: Create a model that includes both known factors and random variables.\n",
    "2. **Distribution Assignment**: Assign probability distributions to the random variables.\n",
    "3. **Repeated Sampling**: Run the model many times (e.g., 10,000 iterations), each time randomly sampling from the defined distributions.\n",
    "4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the collection of results to understand the range and likelihood of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications Beyond Weather\n",
    "\n",
    "This same approach is invaluable in finance, economics, and business for problems like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock price prediction\n",
    "- Risk assessment in project management\n",
    "- Supply chain optimization\n",
    "- Portfolio performance evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "By embracing the uncertainty inherent in these problems, Monte Carlo simulation provides insights into the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities, enabling more informed decision-making in complex, uncertain environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, it's often used for option pricing, where the Black-Scholes-Merton model may not be applicable (e.g., for more complex options or when assumptions of the model are violated).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "1. **Random Walk**: The idea that stock prices follow a random and unpredictable path.\n",
    "2. **Risk-Neutral Valuation**: The principle that the value of an option is its expected future payoff discounted at the risk-free rate.\n",
    "3. **Geometric Brownian Motion**: A continuous-time stochastic process often used to model stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo method for option pricing involves these steps:\n",
    "1. Simulate many random price paths for the underlying asset.\n",
    "2. Calculate the option payoff for each path.\n",
    "3. Take the average of these payoffs.\n",
    "4. Discount this average back to today at the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for simulating stock prices using Geometric Brownian Motion is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_T = S_0 \\exp((r - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) T + \\sigma \\sqrt{T} z)$\n",

    "### NOTE: Numerical Solvers for Optimization Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization problems in economics, finance, and operations research often involve finding the best solution from a set of possible alternatives. While some simple problems can be solved analytically, most real-world optimization problems require numerical methods due to their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical solver is an algorithm or a set of algorithms designed to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. In the context of optimization, these solvers iteratively improve a solution until they reach an optimal (or near-optimal) result within a specified tolerance.\n",

    "### The HiGHS Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "HiGHS (High Performance Software for Linear Optimization) is a state-of-the-art solver for linear programming problems. It was developed at the University of Edinburgh and has become the default solver in SciPy's `linprog` function as of version 1.6.0 [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of HiGHS include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Performance**: HiGHS is designed to be fast and efficient, often outperforming older solvers like the revised simplex method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness**: It can handle a wide range of problem types and sizes with numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Algorithms**: HiGHS incorporates both simplex and interior-point methods, automatically choosing the most appropriate method for a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open Source**: The solver is freely available and can be integrated into various optimization frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "HiGHS uses three main solution methods [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual Revised Simplex**: An efficient implementation of the classic simplex algorithm.\n",
    "- **Interior Point**: A primal-dual interior point method, useful for large-scale problems.\n",
    "- **Simplex**: A primal simplex method, which can be faster for certain problem types.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `scipy.optimize.linprog` with `method='highs'`, the solver automatically chooses between these methods to optimize performance.\n",
